{- Operations on Monadic Streams
   Reimplementation of the functions in Data.List
   Generalization of Data.Stream (Swiestra and van Dijk)

  Notation and terminology:
  We use the same names as for the equivalent functions in Data.List
  with an -MS postfix.
  In general the result of the operation will be inside the monad;
  in cases in which it is 'pure', the postfix becomes -MMS
  Example (from MonStream.hs):
    tailMS  :: MonStr m a -> m (MonStr m a)   works for m Functor
    tailMMS :: MonStr m a -> MonStr m a       works for m Applicative
-}

module Operations where

import MonStreams

import Control.Applicative

instance Alternative m => Alternative (MonStr m) where
  -- empty :: MonStr m a
  empty = MCons empty

  -- (<|>) :: MonStr m a -> MonStr m a -> MonStr m a
  (MCons m1) <|> (MCons m2) = MCons (m1 <|> m2)
  

-- Appending two monsters: the second is grafted when there is an empty action

(+++) :: Alternative m => MonStr m a -> MonStr m a -> MonStr m a
s1 +++ s2 = (headMS s1 <::: ((+++) <$> tailMS s1 <*> pure s2)) <|> s2

instance (Functor m, Foldable m) => Foldable (MonStr m) where
  -- foldMap :: Monoid n => (a -> n) -> MonStr m a -> n
  foldMap f s = foldMap f (headMS s) `mappend`
                foldMap id (fmap (foldMap f) (tailMS s))
