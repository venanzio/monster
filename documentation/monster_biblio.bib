We believe that Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) provides just the right level of functionality to develop simulated worlds in a concise, clear and modular way. We demonstrate the use of FRP in this domain by presenting an implementation of the classic "Space Invaders" game in Yampa, our most recent Haskell-embedded incarnation of FRP.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Haskell}, pages = {7–18}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {hybrid modeling, FRP, modeling languages, functional programming, Haskell, synchronous dataflow languages}, location = {Uppsala, Sweden}, series = {Haskell '03} }

Yet, scratch the surface of the multitude of realisations, and there is great commonality between them. This paper investigates this commonality, turning it into a mathematically coherent and practical FRP realisation that allows us to express the functionality of many existing FRP systems and beyond by providing a minimal FRP core parameterised on a monad. We give proofs for our theoretical claims and we have verified the practical side by benchmarking a set of existing, non-trivial Yampa applications running on top of our new system with very good results. }, journal = {SIGPLAN Not.}, month = sep, pages = {33–44}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {functional reactive programming, monadic streams, reactive program- ming, Haskell, stream programming} }
