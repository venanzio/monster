\begin{abstract}
We define Monadic Streams (MonStr),
give several instantiations and application.
We give instantiation of the Functor, Applicative, Monad classes: the laws are valid under some conditions on the underlying monad.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Intuitive explanation of Monadic Streams and motivation.

\section{Monadic Streams}

Formal definition of Monadic Streams.

\section{Examples}

Instantiations with Identity (Pure Streams), Maybe (Lazy Lists), List (Trees), IO (Processes), State (Stateful Streams).

Definition of the {\em standard} function on those data types in a general way.

\section{Instances of Functor, Applicative, Monad}

Show that monadic streams are an instance of these three classes, under some assumptions about the underlying monad.

So far we determined that we think that MonStr satisfies the monad laws if the underlying monad is commutative and idempotent \cite{idempotent_monads}. (Proof?)

What about Applicative?

Give conterexamples where it isn't a monad (using State).

Also examples when it is a monad even if the underlying monad is not commutative and idempotent: with List as underlying monad we obtain Trees, which are a monad. Can this be generalized.

\section{Applications}

Show a few application and motivate the usefulness of Monadic Streams.

\section{Conclusions}

Discussion of related literature.

Open problems.

Future Work.
